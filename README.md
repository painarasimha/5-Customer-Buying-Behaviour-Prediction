# Customer Purchase Behavior Prediction

## Introduction
Customer Buying Behavior prediction is an important aspect of business to understand their customers and make data-driven decisions. This project aims to analyze the customer data and predict their buying behavior using machine learning techniques.

## Project Objective
 - As mentioned earlier, the objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer buying behavior based on the historical data.
 - Insights gained from this model can help in improving the business in targeted marketing, inventory management and emphasizing on customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in the project is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyamgoyal401/customer-purchases-behaviour-dataset./https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset

It contains the information about customers, their income, loyalty status and other relevant features.

The key features include:
 - Cusomter ID
 - Gender
 - Loyalty Status
 - Purchase Frequency
 - Purchase Amount
 - Product Category
 - Promo Code Usage

## Data Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing includes:
1. Handling missing values.
2. Checking for balance in the features with binary values.
3. Train-test split.

## Model Selection
The following models were tried and tested for this task:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Trees
 - Random Forest
 - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
 - Support Vector Machine(SVM)

## Results
The best model was found to be the Gradient Boosting model with these metrics:
 - Accuracy:
 - Precision:
 - Recall: 
 - F1 Score:

## Conclusion

## Future Enhancements
Future work could include:
 - Using deep learning for better accuracy
 - Using more advanced techniques like ensemble learning and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model performance.
